## Composter

Minecraft mod: Compost stuff!  Turn excess organic material and rotten food into nutrients for plants.

Use excess organic material, excess food, or [rotten food](https://github.com/Stormwind99/FoodFunk/wiki/Rotten-food) from [Food Funk](https://github.com/Stormwind99/FoodFunk) to generate compost - which enhances plant growth like bonemeal.

* Make any item decompose in the compost bin over a specified time (via [configuration](https://github.com/Stormwind99/Composter/wiki/Configuration)).
* Default [configuration](https://github.com/Stormwind99/Composter/wiki/Configuration) entries support vanilla Minecraft and [other mods](https://github.com/Stormwind99/Composter/wiki/Compatibility). 
* Any item from any mod can be [specified](https://github.com/Stormwind99/Composter/wiki/Configuration), and specifiers include support for metadata and ore dictionary names.
