## Composter

Minecraft mod: Compost stuff!  Turn excess organic material and rotted food into nutrients for plants.

Use excess organic material, excess food, or [rotten food](https://github.com/Stormwind99/FoodFunk/wiki/Rotten-food) from [Food Funk](https://github.com/Stormwind99/FoodFunk) to generate compost - which enhances plant growth like bonemeal.
